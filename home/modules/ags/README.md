# AGS Configuration

## Development Setup

To edit the TypeScript/TSX files with full type support, run:

```bash
ags types -u -d .
```

This generates the `@girs/` type declarations and `node_modules/` symlinks required for IDE autocompletion and type checking.

## Usage

For normal usage (applying the configuration), no setup is required. The NixOS configuration handles everything automatically.
