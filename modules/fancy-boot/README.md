# Fancy Boot - Darwin Plymouth Theme

This module configures a macOS-inspired Plymouth boot splash screen.

## Logo Asset

The Darwin theme uses a custom logo image (`logo.png`) that has a non-free license. Due to licensing restrictions, this file is not included in the repository and is excluded via `.gitignore`.

### How to Obtain the Logo

The logo is available from Wikipedia under the non-free fair use policy:

1. Visit: [Wikipedia - Tux (mascot)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tux.png)
2. Download the Tux mascot PNG image
3. Make the background transparent and increase the canvas size to fit the existing logo dimensions (so it doesn't obstruct the splash screen)
4. Rename the downloaded file to `logo.png`
5. Place it in: `modules/fancy-boot/darwin/logo.png`

## Alternative

If you prefer not to use the non-free logo, you can use the existing logo. (No changes are required)
